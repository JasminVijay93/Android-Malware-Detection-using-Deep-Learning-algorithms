# Dissertation Android Malware Detection

#This study examines the various methods for detecting malware on Android and explores how deep learning algorithms might improve the efficiency of detection
and classification tasks. As a result of the rapidly expanding market for Android malware, this issue was investigated to discover a way to prevent malware 
attacks at the early stage of application installation. The primary objective of the study is to use artificial intelligence and big data to identify the 
best deep-learning algorithm for the three types of malware familiesâ€”Banking, SMS, and Ransomware. The novelty of our study lies in the construction of a 
deep learning model for each type of malware family separately. During the experiment, we found that the proposed models were successfully
recognized in over 95.00% of the three selected malware families with the help of our large training dataset.
